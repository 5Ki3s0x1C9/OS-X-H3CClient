H3CClientX
==========

A H3C compatible client for OS X 10.9+ based on previous work [h3cclient b1](http://sourceforge.net/projects/h3cclient/) and [njit8021xclient](http://github.com/liuqun/njit8021xclient).

Stable and working version of H3CClientX can be found at [homepage](http://cppmesh.net/h3cclientx/) with latest update v1.0.1 on Sept 6, 2014.

FYI, this project has been discontinued, since major devs have moved to another campus where H3C protocol is no longer used. However you are welcomed to feedback any issues on current version anytime via GitHub or email (mystery.wd#gmail.com).

For students from other university who's having difficulty in authentication: You can manually compile a newer version of H3CClientX from this repository, since some fixes are not included in the latest installer. See [#1](https://github.com/w1ndy/OS-X-H3CClient/issues/1).
